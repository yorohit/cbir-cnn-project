A. Preprocessing/Training Algorithm:

1) Split dataset into training set and testing set.
2) Perform one pass of the training set images via VGG16 network and store the activations of the last convolution layer. These are the original features.
3) Perform Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensions of the features.
4) Perform intra-class clustering via the K-Means algorithm, with K number of clusters.
5) For classification, train a Multi-Layer Perceptron for the features obtained in A.3

B. Testing Algorithm:

1) Predict the class of the test image using the classification model.
2) Find the closest cluster centroid for the predicted class.
3) Report the top five images from the closest cluster as the results.
